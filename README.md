In this task, you are going to build a code to bake a cake code to always be the right size with the right number of candles.



1. You will create a total of three functions for drawing a layered cake with candles.
2. You will use a repeat() inside another repeat(), creating what's called a "nested loop".



> The way you will build up this code is how you can build up any program, starting with the big picture and adding detail. This is called "top-down development".
> The instructions are not as detailed for this practice, and you can refer to the finished code if you get stuck.




### Here is a picture of the cake you will be baking:
